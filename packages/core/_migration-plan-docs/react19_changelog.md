# React 19 Migration Changelog

## Overview

This document details the migration of Refine from React 18 to React 19, implemented alongside the TanStack Query v5 migration. The React 19 migration maintains **100% backward compatibility** with React 18 while enabling users to upgrade to React 19 when ready.

### Key Principles

- **Dual React Support**: Support both React 18 and React 19 simultaneously
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing React 18 applications continue to work
- **Forward Compatible**: Ready for React 19 adoption
- **Gradual Migration**: Users can upgrade at their own pace

### Migration Strategy

- **Peer Dependencies**: Accept both React 18 and React 19 versions
- **Component Updates**: Ensure all components work with React 19
- **Hook Compatibility**: Maintain hook behavior across versions
- **Testing**: Validate functionality on both React versions
